    <p>A game of three dimensional shape matching, Qubx's easy and intuitive controls make it simple to pick up and play, but hard to master. Manipulate a cube to match incoming shapes to the beat of three different tracks and the ever increasing speed of the shapes. Match multiple shapes simultaneously to score bonuses that can make the difference between being at the top of the table and not even placing.</p>
